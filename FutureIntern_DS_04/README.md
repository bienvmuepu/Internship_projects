Fraud Transaction Detection


This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect potentially fraudulent transactions using credit card transaction data. The process begins with preprocessing the dataset, which includes cleaning the data and addressing class imbalances. A suitable classification algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks, is selected for implementation. The model is trained on labeled data to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. Its performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its accuracy in detecting fraud and enhancing transaction security. The ultimate goal is to improve the reliability and safety of credit card transactions.
