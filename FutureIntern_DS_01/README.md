Development of a Machine Learning Model for Predicting House Prices

This task involves developing a machine learning model using a housing dataset to predict house prices based on features such as square footage and the number of bedrooms. The objective is to create a model capable of accurately estimating house prices, which can assist potential buyers and real estate agents in evaluating property values. The project will include several steps: first, data preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize numerical features to improve model performance. Next, regression techniques such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees will be implemented to train the model. Finally, performance will be evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error on a test dataset, allowing for the measurement of prediction accuracy. This model aims to provide reliable price estimates for new properties, thus facilitating informed decision-making for users.
