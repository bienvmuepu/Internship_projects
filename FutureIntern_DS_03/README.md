Employee Turnover Prediction


This project aims to build a predictive model using employee data to anticipate which employees are likely to leave the company. The process begins with cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. A suitable classification algorithm, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest, is selected for this task. The model is then trained on historical data to learn patterns indicative of employee churn. The accuracy and effectiveness of the model are evaluated using metrics like precision and recall, aiding in proactive employee retention strategies.
