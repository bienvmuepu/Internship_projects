Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media data, specifically tweets and Facebook posts, utilizing machine learning techniques. The text data is meticulously cleaned and preprocessed to eliminate noise and tokenize the content into meaningful features. Various classification models are employed, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and advanced deep learning architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, to accurately classify sentiments into categories of positive, negative, and neutral. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using standard metrics, providing insights into its accuracy and effectiveness in discerning the sentiment expressed in the dataset. The overall goal is to derive meaningful insights into the sentiments prevalent in social media discourse, contributing to a better understanding of public opinion trends.
