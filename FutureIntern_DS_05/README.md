Email Spam Filtering

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to automatically detect spam emails using email data. The process begins with cleaning and preprocessing the email text to prepare it for analysis, which includes tokenization and feature extraction. Classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks are utilized to train the model on labeled data that distinguishes between spam and non-spam emails. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring reliable detection of spam. Ultimately, this model seeks to enhance email security by accurately filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages.
